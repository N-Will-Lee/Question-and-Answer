# Question-and-Answer
A small JS project to practice variables, conditional statements, and the document method getElementById.
This is a project I worked on for a friend who was trying to teach my buddy Roger and I JavaScript.  
Ultimately it was difficult for us to stick to a teaching schedule, but with this project I learned and had fun with it at the same time.
